### **Section 5: Annotation Support**

#### **Question 5.1: What does the @Component annotation do?**

- C) It makes a method run faster
- D) It creates a new thread

**Answer**: B

#### **Question 5.2: How does the container know about @Component classes?**

**Answer**: B

---

### **Section 6: Code Analysis**

#### **Question 6.1: Look at this code and predict the output:**
```java
DefaultListableBeanFactory factory = new DefaultListableBeanFactory();
BeanDefinition def = new BeanDefinition(MyService.class);
factory.registerBeanDefinition("service", def);

MyService s1 = (MyService) factory.getBean("service");
MyService s2 = (MyService) factory.getBean("service");
System.out.println(s1 == s2);
```

- A) true
- B) false
- C) Compilation error
- D) Runtime exception

**Answer**: A (because beans are singletons by default)

#### **Question 6.2: What will this code output?**
```java
AdvisedSupport advised = new AdvisedSupport(target);
advised.setPointcut(Pointcut.TRUE);
JdkDynamicAopProxy proxy = new JdkDynamicAopProxy(advised);
Object proxied = proxy.getProxy();
```

- A) A new instance of the target class
- B) A proxy that wraps the target
- C) null
- D) An exception

**Answer**: B
